Bitburner stuff

Yeah, here are some of the Bitburner scripts that I have found along the way and in some way or another modified to suit my wants. lol

I hope they can help you.

In OptiRunner, I wrote opti-launcher.js to copy the files to all my 25 purchased servers, and run them independently. But it overwhelms Bitburner and crashes the game. So, running it from one server (like pserv-0) is what I am doing right now until it's fixed.

In HWG-v1 there is also a launcher that puts the scripts on the purchased servers. Typically I'll just run these on pserv-1 through pserv-24, and run opti.js on pserv-0. It is what I am doing right now while I work further on opti.js.  However, HWG-v1 does pretty well.
